# Project 1 - Covid Stats

Welcome to our project! As a team of four we have designed and built an interactive front-end application that will display COVID-19 statistics globally and for a chosen country. Our motivation for this project was that we’re stuck in lockdown and COVID-19 is rampaging through the world and we wanted to make sure people are kept up to date with the information they need. Through building this project we learnt the value of teamwork, planning and collaboration! We also learnt how to use a CSS framework, how to connect API's and how to design a polished UX.
